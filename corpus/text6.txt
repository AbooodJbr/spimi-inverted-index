Old Man Tiber, the last lighthouse keeper of Raven's Perch, swore the lighthouse wasn't empty. Not truly. For fifty years, he had tended the beacon, guiding ships through treacherous coastal waters, and for just as long, he had felt the presence of others. Not ghosts, he’d always insisted, but echoes. Residual feelings, perhaps, from all the lives that had passed through its stone walls.
Tonight, a storm raged, the wind howling like a banshee, rain lashing against the thick glass of the lantern room. As Tiber polished the Fresnel lens, a faint, melancholic melody drifted up the spiral staircase. It was a sea shanty, familiar yet elusive, sung by a chorus of long-forgotten sailors. He paused, his calloused hand still on the brass. A child’s giggle followed, light and airy, then the heavy tread of a woman’s boots. Tiber smiled. He knew these echoes. They were the wives who had waited, the children who had played, the men who had kept the light before him. He wasn't alone in his vigil. The lighthouse wasn't just a structure of stone and light; it was a vessel of memory, carrying the intangible imprints of generations. As the storm reached its crescendo, Tiber hummed along with the spectral shanty, a comforting presence in the heart of the tempest, knowing that as long as the light shone, the echoes would continue to dance.
